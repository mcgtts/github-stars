Welcome to image to html. Image to html is designed to allow you to convert images into html pages as the name suggests to do this you will need a few dependencies to be fulfilled.
1. Set up execution enviornment

2. Install imagemagcik and pytesssearct from the cloud repo of your choice. These cannot be put on the included CD as you clone a repo of the same onto your PC

3. Satisfy any other dependencies that might be unique to your system.  MacOS 10.14 and Ubuntu 18.04 has been found to be compatible with this software.

4. Open up terminal navigate to your execution directory and run app.py 

5. Copy and paste the generated port 5000 link into your browser

6. Kill process if needed 

Note: This is intended for development environments so compatibility with windows cannot be guaranteed. As Ubuntu and MacOS are capable of running image magick and other accompanying softwares 
this should work on Mac and Ubuntu. Support for windows hinges on you finding a workaround for missing dependencies
