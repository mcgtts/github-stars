# Longbridge Terminal

An _experimental_ terminal-based app of [Longbridge](https://longbridge.com).

We build this app to help us in development of the cross-platform Rust core library (named: Engine) of Longbridge.

This is also for making a fun, so we can watch the stock market data in the terminal.

Run `longbridge` can start the app.

## QA

- Q: "Another instance is running, please close it first" error.
