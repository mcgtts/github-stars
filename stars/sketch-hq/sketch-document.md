# `.sketch` document

[Sketch](https://sketch.com) stores documents in `.sketch` format, a zipped
archive of JSON formatted data and binary data such as images.

## Sketch file format schemas and APIs.

This project contains the file format specification and APIs to work with Sketch
documents and document elements in TypeScript.

- `@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format`: JSON Schema describing the `.sketch` document
  format.
- `@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts`: TypeScript types to strongly type objects
  representing Sketch documents, or fragments of Sketch documents in TypeScript
  projects.
- `@sketch-hq/sketch-file`: TypeScript APIs to read and write `.sketch` files.

## Development

### Pre-release

> ℹ️ This section is work in progress until we release our first pre-release.
> Pre-releases will be used as a staging area to publish changes to the
> specification required by an as-yet unreleased version of the Sketch Mac app.

1. Create a new branch to track the pre-release, e.g. `v5`
1. Read the changesets pre-release
   [docs](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md)
1. Enter pre-release mode on the branch `yarn changeset pre enter {tag}`
1. Commit the changes and push the branch. This branch will act as a stand-in
   for `main` for all work related to the pre-release
1. PR into the new branch with feature branches, calling `yarn changeset` as per
   normal to signal intents to publish. Since this is a pre-release it's likely
   that we'll be marshalling a major version bump
1. Publishing pre-releases is not automated, so when you're ready to publish the
   pre-release call `yarn changeset version` and then `yarn release`

### Release

1. Following changes, run `yarn changeset` on the feature branch to document
   changes.
1. If changes have been made to the `@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format` make sure to
   include `@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts` in the changeset.
1. On merge, changesets will produce a release pull-request named _Version
   Packages_ with all changes since the last release.
1. Merge the release pull-request maintained by the changesets
   [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) to publish new releases
   to NPM.
